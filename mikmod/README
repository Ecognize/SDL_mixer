 --> MikMod Sound Libraries Version 3.1.12

--
This version of the library is based on the official UNIX MikMod
library version 3.1.12, found at: http://mikmod.raphnet.net/

It has been stripped down for inclusion with Simple DirectMedia Layer,
but the missing drivers and file loaders can be plugged right in from
the MikMod 3.1.12 archive.
